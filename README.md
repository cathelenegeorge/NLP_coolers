# üß™ NLP Experiments Suite

Welcome to the **NLP Experiments Suite** ‚Äì a collection of foundational Natural Language Processing (NLP) experiments designed to explore and demonstrate various techniques in textual data processing and analysis.

## üìÅ Experiments Overview

This repository contains the following experiments:

1. **Word Analysis**  
   Techniques for analyzing individual words in text, including frequency distribution, stemming, lemmatization, and n-gram generation.

2. **Word Generation**  
   Implementation of word-level text generation using models like Markov Chains and basic RNN/LSTM architectures.

3. **Text Classification**  
   Classification of documents or sentences into predefined categories using models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Transformers.

4. **Semantic Analysis**  
   Exploration of semantic similarity and word meaning using methods like WordNet, word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), and BERT-based encoders.

5. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   Detection of sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral) using traditional ML and deep learning models.

6. **Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging**  
   Tagging each word in a sentence with its grammatical role (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) using rule-based and statistical models.

7. **Chunking (Shallow Parsing)**  
   Grouping words into meaningful phrases (noun phrases, verb phrases) using POS tags and chunking rules.
